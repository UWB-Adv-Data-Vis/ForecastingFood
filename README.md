# ForecastingFood
The data dashboard challenge for the Winter 2023 BIS 412 Advanced Data Visualization course. The challenge uses data from the Economic Research Service U.S. Department Of Agriculture (USDA ERS) to visualize historic records of food prices and forecast predictions.

The challenge was authored by Sharmarke M., Justin L., Marc O., Evan C., Wes H., and Yucheng L. from the course BIS 412 and selected by the challenge review committee: Justin L., Rim W., Sindhuja G., and Amanda A. The challenge was edited and supervised by Prof. Caleb Trujillo.

# Challenge Description      
The challenge is to create a dashboard that visualized the change in pricing over a period of the years 1974-2021 within the food industry and forecast these changes. Our goal is to design an accessible platform that represents useful information for farmers, processors, wholesalers, consumers, and policymakers to assist decision-making about the future of pricing and its impacts on our agricultural economy. To meet this challenge, teams should address the following tasks:

-	Display comparisons of successive years in historic records of pricing for each category of food
- Display categories of food speculated to change in the future using forecasting information
-	Visually identify the category of food fluxating the most in pricing at user-selectable time ranges
-	Visually identify the year that showed the largest changes in the consumer price index for user-selected categories of food
